References to single strains annotated as `Strains`.
The original S800 corpus annotation only involves a single annotated mention type (species) that is used to annotate mentions of species names as well as mentions of more specific names such as those of strains. In the revision, we introduced a separate Strain type and revised all strain name mention to use this type, also revising the spans of species annotation to exclude strain names when the two occurred together in text.
