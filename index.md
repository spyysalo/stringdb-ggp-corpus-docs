## Document selection

### Abstract sample 01

A sample of 1000 PubMed abstracts selected by comparing JensenLab tagger GGP matches to mentioned tagged by a BioBERT model trained on the BC2GM corpus and selecting a random subset filling the following criteria:

* Number of unique tagged names (ignoring case) > 1
* Annotations / 100 words >= 1
* 50% < f-score of one tagger against the other < 100%
* No title-only documents
* 50% of mentions need to be forms that have not been seen in abstracts selected so far (case-insensitive)
