## Document selection

### Abstract sample 01

A sample of 1000 PubMed abstracts selected by comparing JensenLab tagger GGP matches to mentiones tagged by a BioBERT model trained on the BC2GM corpus and selecting a random subset filling the following criteria:

* Number of unique tagged names (ignoring case) > 1
* Annotations / 100 words >= 1
* 50% < f-score of one tagger against the other < 100%
* No title-only documents
* 50% of mentions need to be forms that have not been seen in abstracts selected so far (case-insensitive)

---

### Open issues

* GGPs which is usually working/active as homodimer, e.g. IFN-gamma: GGP? Complex? or decide context dependent?
* Families of Complexes

---

### Ambiguities

This section documents the guidelines for specific ambiguities between different annotations.

#### Peptides

[Peptides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide) -- short chains of amino acids -- are not considered proteins in the annotation and thus not annotated as `GGP`. 

**Examples**:

* bradykinin: [CHEBI:3165](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:3165), [PubChem:439201](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/439201)
* angiotensin II: [CHEBI:48432](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:48432), [PubChem:172198](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/172198)

**References**:

[CHEBI:25676 - oligopeptide](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI%3A25676)
: A peptide containing a relatively small number of amino acids. [...] consists of two to twenty amino acids

### Individual cases

NF-ÎºB
: `Complex` (<http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0071159>)

G proteins
: `Family`

angiotensin II
: `Out of scope` (Chemical: <https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/172198>, cleavage product of [Angiotensinogen](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P01019))

* Histones:
  * Tag __H3__ etc. as `GGP` also when they appear standalone
  * Include __histone__ in the span when it appears with one of the names (e.g. _histone H3_)
  * Tag __histone__ as `Family` when it appears standalone.
  * discontinuous or decomposed `GGP` for mentions such as __histones H2A and H3__.
